<center> <strong>Welcome!</strong><br/><br/>
My name is Austin Du, and I'm currently a software engineering student at the University of Waterloo. You may have noticed that this website is quite sparse - that's because it's currently undergoing a booming redesign.
<br/><br/>


Come back soon, and this page will look beautiful.
